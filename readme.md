# Queue-it Bypass

This script only works for events protected by queue-it, like ticketmaster

*Update 12/2025*

This script doesn't works as well as before. You need to solve captchas manually



# Installation

- npm i
- You need to install pupetter, node will try to install it but sometimes you need some extra manuals steps

# Usage

- npm run start
- Enter url of the event
- Press enter to create a new queue
- Solve captcha
- You can now spawn an other queue if you want
- Once the place is found, browser will close, and you will get the url to go to get the queue
